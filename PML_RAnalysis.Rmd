## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(caret)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
setwd("/Users/HimanshuBharara/Desktop/PML")  # or any directory of your choice
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings = c("NA", "#DIV/0!", ""))
testing  <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv",  na.strings = c("NA", "#DIV/0!", ""))
str(training, list.len=15)
table(training$classe)
prop.table(table(training$user_name, training$classe), 1)
prop.table(table(training$classe))
training <- training[, 7:160]
testing  <- testing[, 7:160]
is_data  <- apply(!is.na(training), 2, sum) > 19621  # which is the number of observations
training <- training[, is_data]
testing  <- testing[, is_data]
set.seed(3141592)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.60, list=FALSE)
train1  <- training[inTrain,]
train2  <- training[-inTrain,]
dim(train1)
dim(train2)
nzv_cols <- nearZeroVar(train1)
if(length(nzv_cols) > 0) {
  train1 <- train1[, -nzv_cols]
  train2 <- train2[, -nzv_cols]
}
dim(train1)
library(randomForest)
set.seed(3141592)
fitModel <- randomForest(classe~., data=train1, importance=TRUE, ntree=100)
correl = cor(train1[,c("yaw_belt","roll_belt","num_window","pitch_belt","magnet_dumbbell_z","magnet_dumbbell_y","pitch_forearm","accel_dumbbell_y","roll_arm","roll_forearm")])
diag(correl) <- 0
which(abs(correl)>0.75, arr.ind=TRUE)
cor(train1$roll_belt, train1$yaw_belt)
fitModel <- rpart(classe~., data=train1, method="class")
prp(fitModel)
set.seed(3141592)
fitModel <- train(classe~roll_belt+num_window+pitch_belt+magnet_dumbbell_y+magnet_dumbbell_z+pitch_forearm+accel_dumbbell_y+roll_arm+roll_forearm,
                  data=train1,
                  method="rf",
                  trControl=trainControl(method="cv",number=2),
                  prox=TRUE,
                  verbose=TRUE,
                  allowParallel=TRUE)
predictions <- predict(fitModel, newdata=train2)
confusionMat <- confusionMatrix(predictions, train2$classe)
confusionMat
missClass = function(values, predicted) {
  sum(predicted != values) / length(values)
}
OOS_errRate = missClass(train2$classe, predictions)
OOS_errRate
predictions <- predict(fitModel, newdata=testing)
testing$classe <- predictions
submit <- data.frame(problem_id = testing$problem_id, classe = predictions)
write.csv(submit, file = "coursera-submission.csv", row.names = FALSE)
answers = testing$classe
write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file=filename, quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
write_files(answers)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
varImpPlot(fitModel)
qplot(roll_belt, magnet_dumbbell_y, colour=classe, data=train1)
```

Conclusions
This analysis employed machine learning techniques to build a Random Forest Model capable of classifying how well physical exercises are performed based on wearable-technology data. The most robust predictors were determined using Exploratory Data Analysis. The resultant model has an in-set accuracy of 99%. The analyses are  optimized. It was not possible to fully assess how well the model performed against the test data set and the results are difficult to interpret by eye.



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
